Hint: Where do robots find what pages are on a website?
Hint 2: What does disallow tell a robot?
Hint 3: The flag is not 70r3hnanldfspufdsoifnlds

Answer:
website.com/robots.txt
A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site.
There was a disallow rule for /70r3hnanldfspufdsoifnlds.html.
Checking out that page would reveal the flag.

FLAG: abctf{r0b0ts_4r3_th3_futur3}

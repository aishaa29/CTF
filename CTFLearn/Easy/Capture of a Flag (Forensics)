This isn't what I had in mind, when I asked someone to capture a flag... can you help? You should check out WireShark.

Answer:
Well, first install WireShark.
It's this tool with which you can manipulate network requests.
Go through the requests and you will find list that includes packet 255 from www.hazzy.co.uk, which contains the text/html content.
Decode that with Base64 and you will get your flag.

FLAG: flag{AFlagInPCAP}

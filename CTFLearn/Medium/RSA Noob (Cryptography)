These numbers were scratched out on a prison wall. Can you help me decode them? https://mega.nz/#!al8iDSYB!s5olEDK5zZmYdx1LZU8s4CmYqnynvU_aOUvdQojJPJQ

Answer:
So, you definitely have to check out RSA cryptosyste.
But the essence is,
    c = m^e mod  n
Since is e = 1,
the text is either c,c+n,c+2n.... so on
Let's take a wild guess and assume m = c
Convert c to hex and then to ASCII to get the flag.

FLAG: abctf{b3tter_up_y0ur_e}

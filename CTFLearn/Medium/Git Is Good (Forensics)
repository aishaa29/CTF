The flag used to be there. But then I redacted it. Good Luck.

Answer:
Okay, so this problem exposes you to git. The flag is hidden in one of the old commits.
Extract the file and read the logs by using the command 'git log'
Use git show to expose the commits. The flag is hidden in the second commit.

FLAG: flag{protect_your_git}

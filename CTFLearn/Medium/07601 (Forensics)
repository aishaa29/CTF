I think I lost my flag in there. Hopefully, it won't get attacked...

Answer:
There is a hidden file. Extract it using binwalk. The flag is hidden inside the "I warned you.jpg" file. But, if you look closer, you'd realize that it is actually a .data file. 

Use strings command to extract the flag.

FLAG: ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}
